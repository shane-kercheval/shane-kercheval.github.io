<p>When do you know you should pursue a new business idea?</p>

<p>At IntelliTect, we constantly generate new ideas, ideas that will: help us do our jobs; help others do their jobs; make our lives better. The process is called â€œIdeationâ€, and it is the process of coming up with ideas and figuring out which ideas we should go build. Weâ€™ve come up with some good ideas at IntelliTect, but sometimes our ideas donâ€™t â€œfitâ€ us.</p>

<p>You might have heard of product/market fit, which is how well your productâ€™s value proposition fits your marketâ€™s needs. Idea/founder fit examines how well your idea fits with you, the founder(s).</p>

<p>Letâ€™s say youâ€™ve come up with the next big thing..</p>

<p>What should you do about it? Wait.. backup.. Should <em>you</em> be the one to do something about it?
<strong>Unless you have one or more of the following attributes, you should consider spending your time on other ideas:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>industry expertise</li>
  <li>the problem is your own</li>
  <li>passion about the problem</li>
  <li>orâ€¦ you have one or more of the above â€œby proxyâ€</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="industry-expertise">Industry Expertise</h1>
<p>Do you really know what youâ€™re talking about? Or is your idea based on what you think you understand about some other industry you actually donâ€™t know anything about? Not everyone is an expert in area that they jump into, and thatâ€™s OK. But if youâ€™re not an expert, there needs to be some other motivating factor. (And you better go find an expert.)</p>

<h1 id="solving-a-problem-you-have">Solving a Problem You Have</h1>
<p>If you solve a problem you have, you are essentially your own customer. You will know if youâ€™re successfully solving your problem, how painful the problem is, how it fits into the big picture of your life, and so on. This doesnâ€™t eliminate the need to go out and chat with potential customers and verify your value proposition, but helps to decrease your risk of not finding that product/market fit defined earlier.</p>

<h1 id="solving-a-problem-you-are-passionate-about">Solving a Problem You Are Passionate About</h1>
<p>Are you passionate about the problem? If youâ€™re passionate about something, you will have the willpower to keep driving forward when you run into problems, when you have to adjust, when you donâ€™t know what to do, or when you have to go find someone that does know.</p>

<h1 id="by-proxy">By Proxy</h1>
<p>Thereâ€™s a caveat. If you partner with someone that has one of the previous characteristics, then I guess youâ€™re off the hook. So if youâ€™re passionate about building software, for example, and you find someone who is passionate about the actual problem, or perhaps is an industry expert, Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s a good start. Point: if you think you have the next wizbang idea but you donâ€™t know anything about the industry, arenâ€™t solving a problem you have, or donâ€™t have a passion for the problem, go find someone who does.</p>

<h1 id="remember">Remember</h1>
<p>These rules arenâ€™t an indication of success, they are simply a prequalification for starting. And the more prequalifications that you posses, the better!</p>
