I"*<p><strong>Why do some businesses fail?</strong> Here are the top on my list:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>over-confidence</strong> - people have a tendency to think their idea is great, and assume everyone else will as well; or we’re just over-confident in our abilities</li>
  <li><strong>lack of expertise in the industry</strong> - making assumptions about how the industry works or what it wants is dangerous</li>
  <li><strong>lack of planning</strong> - don’t wing it, do research, write a business plan, or some version thereof</li>
  <li><strong>not identifying our assumptions</strong> - related to the last, people tend not to realize the degree to which they are making assumptions</li>
  <li><strong>not lean enough</strong> - your goal should be to test out your assumptions as quickly as possible, and adjust accordingly</li>
  <li><strong>setting goals and calling that your strategy</strong> - strategy is about identifying obstacles and figuring out how to overcome those obstacles</li>
  <li><strong>lack of focus</strong> - too many features, too many target markets, too many other side-projects</li>
  <li><strong>confirmation bias</strong> - we tend to listen to information that confirms our preconceptions, and ignore the rest</li>
  <li><strong>gut decisions</strong> - decision making based off of data is almost always better than gut decisions; track and measure what you do</li>
  <li><strong>attributing success to oneself, and failure to ‘bad luck’</strong> - dig in to find the reason for success or failure</li>
  <li><strong>bad partnerships</strong> - e.g. not setting the right expectations; inability to have frank discussions</li>
  <li><strong>not enough capital</strong> - we overestimate the market’s response and underestimate how much everything will cost</li>
  <li><strong>the offering lacks value</strong> - isn’t as unique as you thought, isn’t as valuable, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>not profitable</strong> - related to planning above, you simply didn’t do a good job forecasting and anticipating the market’s response</li>
</ul>
