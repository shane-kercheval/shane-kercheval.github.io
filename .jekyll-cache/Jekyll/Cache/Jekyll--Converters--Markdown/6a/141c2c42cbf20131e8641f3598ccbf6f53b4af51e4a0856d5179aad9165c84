<p>One characteristic of a great idea is that it has a ‘moat’, or a competitive advantage, that exists such that the idea can’t be easily copied or stolen.</p>

<p>So if you’re worried that I’m going to steal your idea after a 30-minute conversation, then what’s to keep your competition from doing the same thing once you launch?</p>

<h1 id="ndas-infringe-on-my-right-to-work">NDAs infringe on my right to work.</h1>

<p>To what extent can I or can’t I pursue ideas similar to yours? How similar?</p>

<p>NDAs muddy the water on what I can or can’t work on. And because I’m not sure what projects I will pursue in the future, I can’t make those restrictions.</p>

<h1 id="its-just-one-more-thing-for-me-to-track">It’s just one more thing for me to track.</h1>

<p>For every NDA I sign, I would have to somehow track what I can or can’t disclose, what I can or can’t work on. That sounds exhausting, and I have better things to do.</p>

<h1 id="except">Except…</h1>

<p>There are certain scenarios where NDAs make sense. Typically where there is something tangible to point to.</p>

<p>For example, where there is certain data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers.</p>
