            Starting a startup is difficult. You might have a great idea, but identifying all the possible risks and challenges is either overlooked, or overwhelming. I help entrepreneurs build a strategy that decreases risk and uncovers opportunities.

                        <p  class="list-description">"I have been working with Shane Kercheval for about a year now. Shane understands business, strategy and what it&rsquo;s going to take to make a business successful. He will look at every angle and will come back to you and tell you things that you don&rsquo;t want to hear; he&rsquo;s going to tell you his honest opinion on what needs to be enhanced, changed, or deleted from your business plan. Now as I look back almost a year later, the value that I received from Shane is worth way more then I think he even realizes. Thanks Shane for helping GoDirect Foods start on the right track."</p>
