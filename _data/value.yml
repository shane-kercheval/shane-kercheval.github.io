    testimonial: I have been working with Shane Kercheval for about a year now. Shane understands business, strategy and what it’s going to take to make a business successful. He will look at every angle and will come back to you and tell you things that you don’t want to hear; he’s going to tell you his honest opinion on what needs to be enhanced, changed, or deleted from your business plan. Now as I look back almost a year later, the value that I received from Shane is worth way more then I think he even realizes. Thanks Shane for helping GoDirect Foods start on the right track.
