##If you need an NDA to protect your idea, it's probably not very good.

One of the characteristics of a great idea is that it has a 'moat', or a competitive advantage, that exists such that the idea can't be easily copied or stolen.

So if you're worried that I'm going to steal your idea after a 30-minute conversation, then what's to keep your competition from doing the same thing once you launch?

##NDAs infringe on my right to work.

To what extent can I or can't I pursue ideas similar to yours? How similar?

NDAs muddy the water on what I can or can't work on. And because I'm not sure what projects I will pursue in the future, I can't make those restrictions.  

##It's just one more thing for me to track.

For every NDA I sign, I would have to track somehow what I can or can't disclose, what I can or can't work on. That sounds exhausting, and I have better things to do.

##Except..

There are certain scenarios where NDAs make sense. Typically where there is something tangible to point to.

For example, where there is certain data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers.
