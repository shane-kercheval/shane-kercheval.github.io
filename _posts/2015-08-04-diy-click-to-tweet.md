Want people to tweet your message simply by clicking a link? Don't want to sign up for a service? DIY and follow these 3 steps.

1.  <span style="line-height: 1.5;">write the message that you would like to be tweeted</span>
2.  use a [URL Decoder/Encoder](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/) to turn your message into a encoded URL which you will use in step 3 (it's easy, just click a button)
3.  use Twitter’s [developers](https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button) URL [https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hello%20world](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hello%20world) and replace “Hello%20world” with the encoded URL from step 2 ... DONE!

You can also use [http://bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) if you want to shorten the URL and/or capture basic analytics! For example.

*   The message I want people to be able to click to tweet is: "Want people to tweet your message simply by clicking a link? Don't want to sign up for a service? DIY Click to Tweet. [http://bit.ly/1DqSTaC](http://bit.ly/1DqSTaC)"
*   Run it through the decoder in step 2 and get: "Want%20people%20to%20tweet%20your%20message%20simply%20by%20clicking%20a%20link%3F%20Don%27t%20want%20to%20sign%20up%20for%20a%20service%3F%20DIY%20Click%20to%20Tweet.%20http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1DqSTaC"
*   Combine Twitter's tweet URL from step 3 and your encoded text from step 2 to get (click and test it out) "[https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Want%20people%20to%20tweet%20your%20message%20simply%20by%20clicking%20a%20link%3F%20Don%27t%20want%20to%20sign%20up%20for%20a%20service%3F%20DIY%20Click%20to%20Tweet.%20http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1DqSTaC](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Want%20people%20to%20tweet%20your%20message%20simply%20by%20clicking%20a%20link%3F%20Don%27t%20want%20to%20sign%20up%20for%20a%20service%3F%20DIY%20Click%20to%20Tweet.%20http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1DqSTaC)"
*   Use bit.ly to shorten link and add basic analytics and the final result is: [http://bit.ly/1SJlsqM](http://bit.ly/1SJlsqM)
