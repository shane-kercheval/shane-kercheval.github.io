Why do some businesses fail? Here are the top on my list:

- **over-confidence** - people have a tendency to think their idea is great, and assume everyone else will as well; or we're just over-confident in our abilities
- **lack of expertise in the industry** - making assumptions about how the industry works or what it wants is dangerous
- **lack of planning** - don't wing it, do research, write a business plan, or some version thereof
- **not identifying our assumptions** - related to the last, people tend not to realize the degree to which they are making assumptions
- **not lean enough** - your goal should be to test out your assumptions as quickly as possible, and adjust accordingly
- **setting goals and calling that your strategy** - strategy is about identifying obstacles and figuring out how to overcome those obstacles
- **lack of focus** - too many features, too many target markets, too many other side-projects
- **confirmation bias** - we tend to listen to information that confirms our preconceptions, and ignore the rest
- **gut decisions** - decision making based off of data is almost always better than gut decisions; track and measure what you do
- **attributing success to oneself, and failure to 'bad luck'** - dig in to find the reason for success or failure
- **bad partnerships** - e.g. not setting the right expectations; inability to have frank discussions
- **not enough capital** - we overestimate the market's response, and underestimate how much everything will cost
- **the offering lacks value** - isn't as unique as you thought, isn't as valuable, etc.
- **not profitable** - related to planning above, you simply didn't do a good job forecasting and anticipating the market's response
