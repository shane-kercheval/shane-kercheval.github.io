_Some logicians state that the claim [x unless y] is the logical equivalent of [if ~y, then x] (read ‘if not y, then x’). However, this is not true in all cases and, in my analysis below, I will show the scenarios where this translation is valid and where it is not._

Knowing how to interpret and think critically about common speech and writing patterns is important, especially, for example, when reading and writing contracts (lawyers like to intentionally confuse the reader and make broad statements that, interestingly, are (perhaps mistakenly) not logically equivalent to how they are intended to be used, which could affect how well the contract holds up in court). Recently, I have started to read ‘[Critical Thinking: A User's Manual](http://amzn.com/0495814075)’, which is an excellent guide and resource for evaluating arguments/claims which is useful, for example, when for reading/writing contracts, news articles, or just during casual conversation (Has any ever told you something or made an argument that you thought wasn't quite right, but you were not sure why?). As a computer science major, I'm familiar with truth tables and logical expressions for the basic operators (e.g. and, or, nand, nor, negation, etc.). However, the book presented an expression that I was not familiar with: [x unless y]. We all use this expression often when we communicate and 'intuitively' we all understand what it means... But what about logically, when evaluating the truth value of (x) and (y) and the associated implications? The authors of the book (and other experts on the topic from what I can tell) state that the claim [x unless y] is logically equivalent to the claim [if (not y) then x], where (not y), also known as (~y), is the antecedent of the [if/then] clause and (x) is the consequent. So for example:

*   x = I will pet the dog.
*   y = The dog bites me.
*   [x unless y] : _I will pet the dog_ unless _the dog bites me_.
*   The previous bullet is equivalent to [if ~y then x]: If _the dog <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't </span>bite me_, then _I will pet the dog_.

At a glance, this seems logical. However, we have to compare the truth tables of each claim to determine logical equivalence. Note that we will use our intuition to evaluate the [_unless_] clause, and compare it to the [standard truth table for the [If/then]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table) clause, shown below:

[![If then truth table](http://shanekercheval.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/If-then-truth-table.png "If Then Truth Table")](http://shanekercheval.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/If-then-truth-table.png)

Note that when the antecedent is false, the [if\then] claim is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent. This is because logic (of the [if/then] claim) dictates that we are explicitly stating the value of the consequent dependent on a true antecedent, but if the antecedent is false, then all bets are off: the consequent may be true or it may be false. For example, a teacher may say “If you study hard, then you will get a good grade”. But what if you don’t study hard? Well, then you may or may not get a good grade. The teacher did not explicitly say what would happen if you did not study hard. Thus, if the antecedent is false (i.e. you didn't study hard), the consequent may or may not be true, but the overall claim is still true. This is important when we evaluate and compare the truth table above with the [unless] truth table below:

[![Unless truth table](http://shanekercheval.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Unless-truth-table.png "Unless Truth Table")](http://shanekercheval.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Unless-truth-table.png)

The last row shows that these two claims are NOT logically equivalent. In the case that (x) and (y) are both true in the [unless] claim (and what is supposed to be the logical equivalent in the [if/then] claim: the antecedent is false and the consequent is true), the two claims produce different results. As we can see, in this scenario, the claims [x unless y] and [if ~y then x] are not logically equivalent. However, there are times when authors’ rule is correct, and the same scenario produces consistent results, making the [unless] claim logically equivalent to the [if/then] claim. Consider the example that the authors use in the book (page 190):

*   x = It is not raining.
*   y = There are clouds in the sky.
*   [x unless y]: _It is not raining_ unless _there are clouds in the sky_.
*   The previous bullet is equivalent to [if ~y then x]: If _there are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> clouds in the sky_, then _it is not raining_.

We will skip the truth table and only look at the scenario that caused the problem above (when (x) and (y) are both true in the [unless] clause, causing an inconsistent result with the [if/then] claim). In this scenario, our claim is that “_It is not raining_ unless _there are clouds in the sky_”, and we are confirming that x is true (i.e. it is not raining) and y is true (i.e. there are clouds in the sky). These two claims combined (i.e. that it is possible for clouds to be in the sky when it is not raining) don’t damage the validity of the original claim [unless statement], whereas the previous combination of a true x (i.e. I will pet the dog) and true y (i.e. the dog bites me) in the last scenario does damage validity of the [unless] statement. So what is the difference? The difference *appears* be in what y is implying (i.e. if y implies both x or ~x can be true). This is because a false antecedent (in the translated [if/then] clause), which is logically equivalent to y (i.e. ~(~y) = y), implies the consequent (x) can be true or false, so if that is not the intent of the person using the [unless] claim, making the direct translation to [if (~y) then x] will not produce the desired results. In the rain/clouds example, y (clouds in the sky) can imply x or ~x (i.e. clouds in the sky can imply either that it is not raining (x) or is raining (~x); we don’t know, or care). In the pet/bite example, y (the dog bites me) does NOT imply either x or ~x can be true (i.e. the dog biting me means I will not pet it (~x); we do care!). For another example, consider: ‘you won’t win the lottery’ (x) unless ‘you buy a lottery ticket’ (y). In this case, does (y) imply (x) or (~x) can be true? In other words, does buying a lottery ticket imply you can win the lottery (x) or not win the lottery (~x)? Absolutely, that is the case every day. Since (y) implies either (x) or (~x), it can be translated to [if ~y then x]. Finally, in the case that y is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> implying either (x) or (~x) (as in the pet/bite example), the truth table is logically equivalent to the [exclusive or](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), which can be used as a logical substitution.   Note: there must be a way to mathematically (logically) prove that my theory is correct or incorrect, but I will leave that to the Ph.D.’s!
